# ODP Identity Service

***This project has been merged into [Open-Data-Platform](https://github.com/SAEONData/Open-Data-Platform).***

The SAEON Open Data Platform (ODP) consists of a diverse array of loosely coupled web applications and services.
The ODP Identity Service is intended to provide a unified user registration and sign-on experience across the
entire platform.

The service is a [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web application. It integrates with the open
source, self-hosted [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/) system - an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
provider that performs authentication, session management and issuance of ID, access and refresh tokens.

## Installation

### System dependencies

* Python 3.6
* PostgreSQL 10

### Project dependencies

* [ODP-AccountsLib](https://github.com/SAEONData/ODP-AccountsLib)
* [Hydra-Admin-Client](https://github.com/SAEONData/Hydra-Admin-Client)
* [Hydra-OAuth2-Blueprint](https://github.com/SAEONData/Hydra-OAuth2-Blueprint)

### Database setup

The ODP Admin service should be used to initialize the accounts database.

### Quick start

Create a `.env` file, as described under **Configuration**. Then, to start the development server,
`cd` to the project root directory, activate the virtual environment, and run:

    flask run --host=localhost --port=nnnn

N.B. Flask's built-in server is not suitable for production. See [this page](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/)
for deployment options.

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables, which can be automatically loaded from a `.env`
file located in the project root directory. See `.env.example` for an example configuration.

### Environment variables

Applicable environment variables are listed below with example / allowed values:

#### Standard Flask config

- **`FLASK_APP`**: `odpidentity`
- **`FLASK_ENV`**: `development`|`testing`|`staging`|`production`; note: setting `FLASK_ENV=development` disables TLS
    certificate verification when making requests to the Hydra server
- **`FLASK_DEBUG`**: enabled by default if `FLASK_ENV=development`; you may want to disable this (`FLASK_DEBUG=False`)
    if debugging in an IDE
- **`FLASK_SECRET_KEY`**: sets the Flask [SECRET_KEY](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/config/#SECRET_KEY)

#### Database config

- **`DATABASE_URL`**: URL of the ODP Accounts database, e.g. `postgresql://dbuser:pwd@host/dbname`
- **`DATABASE_ECHO`**: set to `True` to emit SQLAlchemy database calls to stderr (default `False`)

#### Mail server config

- **`MAIL_SERVER`**: mail server hostname / IP address
- **`MAIL_PORT`**: mail server port (default `25`)

#### Hydra admin config

Settings pertaining to integration with Hydra's login, consent and logout flows, in which the Identity Service
plays the role of identity provider:

- **`HYDRA_ADMIN_URL`**: URL of the Hydra admin API
- **`HYDRA_LOGIN_EXPIRY`**: number of seconds to remember a successful login (default `86400` = 24 hours)

#### Hydra client config

Settings pertaining to the usage of Hydra as OAuth2 / OpenID Connect provider, for users logging into and working
with the Identity Service as a client application:

- **`HYDRA_PUBLIC_URL`**: URL of the Hydra public API
- **`OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID`**: client ID of this service as registered with Hydra
- **`OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`**: client secret of this service as registered with Hydra
- **`OAUTH2_SCOPES`**: `openid`
- **`OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT`**: set to `True` in development, to allow OAuth2 to work when running the server on HTTP (default `False`)
